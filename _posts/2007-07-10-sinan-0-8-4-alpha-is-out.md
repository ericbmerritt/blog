================

The [latest version](http://code.google.com/p/sinan/downloads/list) of
Sinan is out. This version adds support for spawning a new Erlang node
with shell for the current project. This makes debugging and
exploratory programming much, much easier. It also spawns the node
with an sname 'sinan\_shell' so that the new shell will interact well
with distel. This is a change that a lot of people have asked for and
I am pleased to be able to integrate it.

I am still having issues with the analyze task that I am working
through. However, I hope to have it fixed and working shortly.
