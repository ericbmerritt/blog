title: Introducing ErlangCamp

{{ page.title }}
================

Every year Martin Logan, Jordan Wilson and myself put on conference
called [ErlangCamp](http://erlangcamp.com). We have done it for three
years so far; Chicago in 2010, Boston in 2011 and now A Coru単a, Spain
People come from all over the world to spend two days talking about
engineering highly resilient systems with Erlang and OTP. They spend
time with some of the most prominent engineers in the Erlang world and
they learn a lot in a short amount of time. However, it isn't a
conference in the normal sense. At ErlangCamp we have one goal and one
goal only; that is to get people over the "hump" of learning OTP and
how to build big reliable systems in just two days. Its much more of
an intense two day workshop or training class then it is a normal
conference. Its tough to keep up, but you learn a ton. Best of all its
a very good value at just around $100.

Why is it so inexpensive? We price it that way so that people are able
to come. For better or worse it is still the case that most people in
the Erlang world are doing Erlang on the side, in their personal
projects, or as a small test project in their company. They dont have
the financial backing or resources of their company and so end up
paying for the Camp out of their own pocket. We are interested in
seeing those folks learn even more. We want to see them become the
seed of Erlang at whatever organization they are in and we absolutely
love to see the community grow. So we charge just enough to cover our
expenses and we, more or less, donate our time and efforts to the cause of
getting them up to speed on some of the most critical parts Erlang. It's
good for them, the attendee; it's good for the Erlang community and, in
the long run,its good for everyone involved. It's a good times and you
should be a part of it.

This year we are doing the conference in the Galician city of
[A Coru単a](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Coru%C3%B1a) on October 5th
and 6th. A Coru単a beautiful town on the northern coast of Spain. It is
a nice vacation spot in it's own right and we are getting unbelievable
support from the Universidade de Coru単a, and the especially the
computer science department. This is going to be one of the liveliest
ErlangCamps since we did the first one in Chicago in 2010.

This year we have also added a couple of interesting features. One of
the biggest ones is the chance for attendees to have dinner with the
Speakers. Basically,
[for the cost of your ticket + the cost of a nice dinner](http://erlangcampcoruna2012.eventbrite.com/)
you get to spend several hours on Friday night Martin, Jordan and
myself anything you would like. That is an opportunity that's worth
the cost.

We are really proud of the work we have done with ErlangCamp and how
these Camps have helped many people in the Erlang Community. This is
your chance to become part of that and its a great excuse to spend a
couple days in Spain learning about one of the best and most
interesting software platforms out there.
