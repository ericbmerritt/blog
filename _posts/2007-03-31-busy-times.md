================

I have had a bit of a perfect storm this week. I decided to upgrade my
Ubuntu to feisty. Although the upgrade went very nicely it took a
couple of days to get the configuration the way I like it. It always
does. I tend to tweak my setup to no end. Well after all that the OTP
folks went and released the new version of Erlang so it took a few
days to get the repository updated. At last, though, things have
settled down and I am able to get back into sinan development. So I
should be releasing a couple of new versions of the alpha over the
next few days.

On a side note, Ubuntu feisty just rocks. It has, by far, the best
wireless support that I have seen any any distribution. That alone
makes it worth the upgrade. If you haven't already done it I suggest
that you do the upgrade.
