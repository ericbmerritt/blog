I have had a bit of a perfect storm this week. I decided to upgrade my
Ubuntu to feisty. Although the upgrade went very nicely, it took a
couple of days to get the configuration the way I like it. It always
does. I tend to tweak my setup to no end. Well after all that the OTP
folks went and released the new version of Erlang so it took a few
days to get the repository updated. At last, though, things have
settled down, and I can get back into Sinan development. So I should
be releasing a couple of new versions of the alpha over the next few
days.

On a side note, Ubuntu feisty just rocks. It has, by far, the best
wireless support that I have seen any distribution. That alone makes
it worth the upgrade. If you haven't done it already, I suggest that
you do the upgrade.
