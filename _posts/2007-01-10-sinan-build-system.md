================

I have been working on a build system for erlang for some time. I have
a working version that I have used. However, it has a couple of
shortcomings that rendered it difficult to use. I done some
significant work towards version two. I decided to make the source
available via google code hosting anyway. There is a large amount of
proprietary software and systems going on in the community right now
and I wanted to be in the open from the start.

the source is [here](http://code.google.com/p/sinan).

Its named after
[á¸²oca Miâ€˜mÄr SinÄn Ä€Ä¡Ä](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinan) one
of the great architects and builders of the Ottoman Empire. I thought
it appropriate to name a build system after him.
