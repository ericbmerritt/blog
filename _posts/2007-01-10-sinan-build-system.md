I have been working on a build system for Erlang for some time. I have
a working version that I have used. However, it has a couple of
shortcomings that rendered it difficult to use. I did some significant
work towards version two. I decided to make the source available via
Google code hosting. There is a large amount of proprietary software
and systems going on in the community right now, and I wanted to be in
the open from the start.

The source is [here](https://github.com/erlware-deprecated/sinan).

I named it after [Mimar
Sinan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimar_Sinan) one of the great
architects and builders of the Ottoman Empire. I thought it
appropriate to name a build system after him.
