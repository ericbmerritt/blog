I have moved into client side code. To save a little time I am
building the Client code on top of
[jspkg](http://jspkg.sourceforge.net/). It needs quite a bit of
refactoring as well as some conversion to work on top of
prototype. However, it should fill my needs nicely. Once the packaging
is in place, I can build up a nice messaging layer.
