================

So we have moved right along and we are very close to release. Before
we do a general release we decided to do something of a small beta. We
are trying to get together a group of solid people who know Erlang
that are interested in using the system. They shouldn't mind going to
a bit of extra trouble to provide us with useful information. They
also need to be able to put up with potential issues that might arise
from using the new build system. If you want to participate either
post a comment to this blog letting me know or send an email to me or
Martin Logan. You can find both of our email addresses in the
[erlang-questions archives](http://www.erlang.org/faq.html). Once you
do that we will provide you with some nice tarballs and pointers to
the documentation.
