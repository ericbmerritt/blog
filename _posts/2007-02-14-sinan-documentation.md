The documentation for Sinan goes apace. I have finished all of the
user level documentation and have started the developer documentation.

Why worry about developer documentation? Sinan is a very pluggable
system. Most of the current functionality that ships with the system
is composed of Tasks that get plugged into the engine. Third party
Tasks will use the same mechanism and be first class parts of the
system right along with them. I think this is pretty darn important
and I want to support it right out of the box. That's why I am
spending a bit of extra time and getting the developer documentation
out with the user docs.
