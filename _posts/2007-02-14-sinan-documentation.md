================

The documentation for Sinan goes apace. I have finished all of the
user level documentation and have started the developer documentation.

Why worry about developer documentation? Sinan is a very pluggable
system. Most of the current functionality that ships with the system
is composed of tasks that are plugged into the engine. Third party
tasks will use the exact same mechanism and be first class parts of
the system right along with them. I think this is pretty darn
important and I want to support it right out of the box. Thats why I
am spending a bit of extra time and getting the developer
documentation out with the user docs.
