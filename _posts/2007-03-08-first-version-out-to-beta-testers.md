I just sent the first usable version of Sinan out to the beta testers
who registered their interest. I expect there to plenty of
issues. However, the fact that the product is out in the wild is
significant. I can't wait to see the feedback, both positive and
negative, that should come in. I will try to relay some of the
relevant bits here on this blog.
