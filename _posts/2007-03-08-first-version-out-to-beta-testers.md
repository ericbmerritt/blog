================

I just sent the first really usable version of sinan out to the beta
testers who registered their interest. I expect there to plenty of
issues. However, the fact that the product is out and being used is
great. I can't wait to see the feedback, both positive and negative,
that should come in. I will try to relay some of the relevant bits
here on this blog.
