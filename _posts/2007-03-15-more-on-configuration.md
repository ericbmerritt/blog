================

The first, lightly tested, version of
[fconf](http://code.google.com/p/fconf/) is out. At the moment its
undocumented, but that should change pretty quickly. Its a otp app
that supports multiple simultaneous configurations and merging configs
together. It supports everything that I talked about in my last
[post](http://erlangish.blogspot.com/2007/03/configurations.html). Sinan
has already been ported over to fconf from its built in configuration
system.
