title: Bad Talks And How To Avoid Them
tags: [philosophy,talks]
---

I have given a lot of talks over the last ten years or so some good
and some bad. There are three talks that specifically stand out in my
mind and bad talks from the last few years. The first was an
introductory talk that we call 'Essentials' that I gave at StrangeLoop
in 2011, the second was the same Essentials talk that I gave at the
Indianapolis Java Users group last year. The third and final talk and
the one that got me thinking about this topic was a talk on release
handling in A Coruña Spain last week. Each of these talks was bad, far
below what I consider an acceptable level. The reason these three
stand out is that they were all bad for the same reason and that
reason was over-confidence.

What do I mean by that? For better or worse, I am an expert in
Erlang. I have been writing Erlang code and studying the Erlang
Virtual Machine and runtime system for the better part of ten years. I
am confident in my knowledge of Erlang. I also have a huge amount of
experience as a speaker. I have been getting up in front of people and
giving talks about various topics since I was nine or ten years old. I
have, specifically, been getting up in front of technical audiences
for the better part of ten years and giving talks on various topics. So
when you are very comfortable in front of people and you know your
material well it is easy to get lazy. That's what happened in each of
these cases. I got lazy; I assumed I knew the material well enough to
give the talk and didn't give enough effort to preparation.

In the end, giving a good talk is less about knowing your material
then about making sure your material is coherent. You do need to know
the material, of course, but you also need to go through and make sure
the information you are providing is in a form that your audience can
consume. That is a very different thing then giving a talk off the
cuff. So even when you know the material you need to order that
material and massage it. You need to *present* it. Then you need to
get familiar with that order and that presentation so you can
integrate it into your approach.

I gave the Essentials talk again in A Coruña and did pretty well. All
it took was going over the material once or twice, making sure I
understood the order and form and the reason for that order and
form. That small investment in time resulted in a huge improvement in
the quality of the talk. I should have done the same thing for the
Release Handling talk, but I fell into the old trap again. I won't say
that I won't make this mistake again because it's the trap that is so
easy to fall into. However, its something I am armed against now and
will hopefully avoid.
