## Experience

### 2015-Present - VP of Engineering, Stealth FinTech Startup, Bellevue, WA.

I am in the process of kicking off a new, well funded, Fintech Startup
in the Fraud Detection space. We have hired the team, designed the
system built the MVP.

### 2013–2015 Senior Software Engineer, Amazon.com, Seattle, WA.

I was recruited to bring expertise in distributed systems and green
field projects to a new organization within Amazon whose purpose and
scope remain confidential.

* I was brought in as employee number three to build out a complex
  distributed systems platform. My primary tasks was to architect the
  team that would build out this platform. I set the hiring bar,
  directed the recruiting organization, attended relevant conferences
  pitching potential candidates and interviewed and managed the intake
  process. I built an accomplished team that was able to deliver the
  project.
* The goal of this project was to accomplish something unique that had
  never been dome before. Amazon's highest levels of leadership funded
  the project as a gamble, believing that it was unlikely to succeed,
  but the value of success was high enough to justify the financial
  risk. I was brought in to design the platform and supporting systems
  and drive the project to completion. We successfully delivered the
  project, earning the trust of management and our customers.
* Given the nature of the platform, finding the required skill sets
  for this project was tough. Only a small proportion of the
  population of Software Engineers had the skill set needed to build
  this system. As the primary technical leader of the Organization, I
  had the responsibility to grow the engineering staff to meet the
  demand and ensure that the Engineers had the required skills. In
  both the design of the system and the work organization, I took into
  account the relative strengths of the team along with talks and
  individual mentoring. By the time the project was in full swing,
  each team member was capable and experienced in required areas with
  the ability to speak and think clearly in probabilistic and
  statistical approaches needed.

### 2011–2015 CTO/Founder, Afiniate, Inc., Washington DC.

I founded Afiniate, Inc. with my business partner and served as the
technical Co-Founder, recruiter, and manager.

* When we started, my partner and I had nothing more than an idea and
  a Lean Canvas business plan. As the Technical Co-founder, my
  responsibility was architecting the team that would build our
  project. I was able to bring on four extremely competent engineers
  and contributing members of the staff with equity as the sole
  compensation. This allowed us to design and build complex and
  functional systems that we would not have otherwise due to financial
  constraints.

* Our initial plan called for real-time analytics of financial data in
  the banking sector. I designed and implemented a distributed rules
  evaluation engine. This system was based on horizontally distributed
  version of RETE algorithm. I designed and implemented the prototype
  as a sales tool.

* We pivoted and applied our rules system to the operations
  space. This pivot increased the scale in which we needed to operate
  by an exponential amount. Our existing implementation could not
  scale to the level required, so I redesigned the system. I built a
  system that was able to scale to a horizontally using a previously
  unknown approach to distributed, recursive pattern recognition. The
  new system was capable of doing complex pattern recognition on a
  large amount of data with the unit of variance being the number of
  hardware resources involved. We implemented this system and got
  through initial tests before running out of funding

### 2012–2013 Manager Architect, Five9, Inc., San Ramon, CA.

I organized, architected and managed the development of Five9’s next generation platform distributed telephony platform.

* Five9 had an existing successful, but monolithic call center
  platform with significant stability problems. The CTO brought me in
  to redesign the system in a fault tolerant, distributed manner. I
  assessed the existing system and organization. I designed an
  eventually consistent actor based distributed system to replace that
  existing system. I led the engineering organization to build and
  deploy the system.

* Five9 had no distributed systems expertise when I joined. I
  organized a small group of senior engineers and intensively mentored
  them on the fundamentals of distributed system design and
  implementation. Over the course of several months, these senior
  engineers become proficient in those fundamentals and become sources
  of mentoring for the rest of the organization. By the end of the
  project most of the organization had a decent fundamental
  understanding of the probabilistic thinking needed to successfully
  design and implement these systems.

* Five9 had few quality processes as an organization. In the interests
  of being able to deliver a stable fault tolerant system I designed
  and help implement a full suite of expected quality processes and
  infrastructure to support continuous delivery of the new
  platform. Within a few months we where able to have instant
  continuous delivery of all code changes to the new product.

### 2008–2010 Senior Software Engineer, PEAK6 Investments LP, Chicago IL.

I was brought in to start a greenfield High-Frequency Trading system and build the team and infrastructure to support it.

* PEAK6 decided to get into the market of high-frequency trading with
  the goal to be better able to compete with its competitors. I was
  brought in to design and help build that system. I developed an
  actor based system with design concessions to optimize for vertical
  vs. horizontal scaling requirements. We delivered a system based on
  this design. This system was able to leverage the many-core
  architecture of its target hardware and have throughput and response
  times that where 50% of the target SLA. Those SLAs were consistent
  with competitors that implemented their systems directly in
  hardware.

* A primary goal of this system was to allow Quantitative Analysts and
  Traders to implement strategies that leveraged this system
  efficiently, with undo complexity in Strategy definition. I designed
  and implemented a Domain Specific Language for Strategy development
  and the compiler infrastructure to allow the Strategy to perform
  competitively to hand coded Strategies. The DSL allowed those
  strategies to take advantage of the unique properties of the trading
  platform. The Traders were able to create strategies that
  successfully competed in a very competitive space.

### 2004–2008 Software Development Engineer, Amazon.com, Seattle.

* Amazon expends a tremendous amount of time and money in
  recruiting. I launched a project to reduce those costs. The human
  cost of the process is the highest cost. To address this, I worked
  out a system that used machine learning techniques to automate the
  first part of the human interaction in the process. Using Amazon’s
  rich corpus of interview pipeline results, I invented a way to
  predict the likely results for each leg of the process. After
  several iterations, the system could correctly predict whether a
  candidate would pass the dual phone screen procedure with a 70%
  success rate and the full loop with a 65% rate.

* Amazon introduced the concept of the Two Pizza Team with a fitness
  function. Creating a correct Fitness Function and observing the
  result was an important part of the Two Pizza Team concept. I
  created a the time series manipulation DSL and supporting
  infrastructure so that our customers could iterate on functions. I
  designed the language, implemented it and iterated with customers
  until the language was optimal. I built an IDE that allowed the
  customers to manipulate the fitness function and view the result in
  real time. We successfully rolled out the result to all Two Pizza
  teams, and it was used exclusively to manage and present their
  metrics.

* The VP of Developer Services was interested in the space of real
  time analysis of human movement over pages on the retail website and
  the internet as a whole. The goal was to immediately leverage high
  levels of interest in a particular page and the increased flow of
  traffic over related pages. I, along with a Principal Engineer and a
  Senior Scientist designed and implemented a system of real-time
  metrics collection and graph analysis system so that that flow of
  information could be collected, analyzed and used while it was still
  valuable. We implemented prototypes for the system and successfully
  tested it on the retail website, subsidiary sites and engaged beta
  partners.

### 2001–2004 Senior Programmer Analyst, Stearling Healthcare, Inc., Raliegh-Durham, NC.

I led the design and implementation of the Emergency Room Staffings
companies primary contract management system.

* The company was spending a significant amount of money on a contract
  management system purposed for legacy mid-range hardware. I
  implemented a replacement system for commodity hardware. I designed
  and implemented new software, iterating with internal customers. We
  delivered the new software and were able to deprecate and remove the
  existing systems. The system allowed the company to eliminate the
  legacy mid-range systems and reduce hefty licensing fees by a
  significant margin.

### 1999–2001 Consultant, McCormack & Associates, Inc., Charlotte, NC.

I built an in-house e-commerce platform.  When that platform was
complete switched over to consulting work for various Fortune 500
companies.

* I implemented an end to end solution for electronic commerce. We
  delivered the software in time for its public release allowing
  McCormack & Associates to enter a new market successfully.

### 1996–1999 Database Administrator, Universal Solutions, Inc., Winston-Salem, NC.

* I designed and implemented several groupware applications using
  Lotus Notes.
* I provided information management tools for existing RPG/OS400
  applications as well as data integration for non-OS400 applications.
* I designed and implemented a QA system and trained the initial QA
  team members in their responsibilities.
